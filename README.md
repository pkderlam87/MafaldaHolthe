This project is a website to promote the work of Mafalda Holthe. She started as an entrepreneur a few months ago and wanted a page for her clients to contact her and apply their decorations.

- to search on the site;
- show the services;
- check a specific service;
- send messages to Mafalda;
- authenticate an user;
- access the list of enquiries and contact;
- add a new service.
